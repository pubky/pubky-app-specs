//! The 0.x reader, frozen at the 0.8.0 pin so a v0 ingest verdict never moves.
//!
//! Every file under this module is the 0.8.0 source, copied unchanged except for import
//! paths and the stripped JS bindings. Its `url::Url` parsing, its `mime` gate, its
//! `.trim()`/`to_lowercase()` and its error messages ARE the verdict real v0 data was
//! accepted or rejected under, so they are deliberately outside the v1 rules and are never
//! edited, improved or aligned. Indexers read un-migrated data through it forever and the
//! migration transforms read v0 objects through it.
//!
//! One thing is shared rather than copied: [`PubkyId`] is the crate's id type. Two id types
//! would fork every signature a consumer writes, so there is one, and it checks the format,
//! a 52-character z-base32 string.
//!
//! That is a real widening on one axis. 0.8.0 compiled to native also required the decoded
//! bytes to be an Ed25519 curve point; compiled to wasm32 it did not, and this module does
//! not. So a 52-character z-base32 string that decodes cleanly but is not a curve point is
//! accepted here and by v0 on wasm32, and was rejected by v0 on native. It reaches URI hosts
//! through [`try_parse_pubky_path`], the ids of [`PubkyAppFollow`] and [`PubkyAppMute`], and
//! the item hosts of a collection post. Tag and bookmark `uri` fields were never curve
//! checked in v0 at all, they go through `url::Url`. A consumer that holds one of these as a
//! real public key, to verify a signature or to fetch from a homeserver, does the curve check
//! itself; the decode is not one.
//!
//! On another axis it is stricter, on purpose. 0.8.0 decoded with `base32::decode`, which
//! ignores the 4 filler bits of the last character, so a 52-character key ending in anything
//! but `y` or `o` passed, and on native was rewritten to the standard spelling. [`PubkyId`]
//! rejects that key as a URI host, a follow or mute id and a collection item host.
//! Accepting it would give one user several keys, one per spelling.
