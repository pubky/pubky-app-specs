opt-level = "z"   # Requests maximum optimization for binary size (“z” stands for “size”), rather than speed.
lto = true        # Enables link-time optimization, allowing the compiler to do more aggressive inlining/dead-code elimination across crates.
codegen-units = 1 # Forces compilation into a single code-generation unit, further helping inlining and dead-code elimination at link time.
panic = "abort"   # Ensures panics do not generate extra stack-unwinding code, reducing binary bloat. Panics will simply abort execution.
